  <h1>Pulse SMS — Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 15, 2026</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you text Pulse, we receive your phone number and the content of your SMS messages. We use this information solely to process your request and send you event recommendations.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your phone number is used to send SMS replies with event recommendations.</li>
    <li>Your message content is used to determine your neighborhood and preferences.</li>
    <li>We may temporarily store your session data (recent picks, neighborhood) to support follow-up commands like DETAILS and MORE. Session data expires after 2 hours.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, share, or rent your phone number or personal data to third parties.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for marketing purposes beyond the event recommendations you request.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store message history beyond the active session.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Pulse uses Twilio to send and receive SMS messages. Twilio's privacy policy applies to message transmission. We use Anthropic's Claude AI to process event recommendations. Message content is sent to Anthropic's API for processing but is not stored by Anthropic beyond the API request.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Session data (your last neighborhood, recent event picks) is stored in memory only and is automatically deleted after 2 hours or when the server restarts. We do not maintain a persistent database of user information.</p>

  <h2>Opt-Out</h2>
  <p>You can stop receiving messages at any time by texting <strong>STOP</strong> to our number. You will receive no further messages after opting out.</p>
